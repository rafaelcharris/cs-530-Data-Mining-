# CS 530 Data Mining

This repository contains all the my homeworks for the CS 530 course.

* `LinearRegression.ipynb`: In this notebook, I implement an OLS regression 'by hand' on a data set of school achievement in portuguesse high schools. Different to how it is used in economics and other social sciences, I use the OLS to predict grades in a test dataset in a Machine Learning fashion.
* `Naive Bayes Classifier.ipynb`: In this notebook I apply Naive Bayes Classifier to a breast cancer data set, and compare my version with `scikit-learn` built in version.
* `Neural Networks Part 1.ipynb`: In this notebook, I implement a neural network using keras to predict house prices
* `Neural Networks Part 2.ipynb`: In this notebook, I fine tune a HuggingFace model that classify tweets as ironic
* `Random Forest.ipynb`: In this notebook, I implement a Random Forest algorithm by hand. Later, I trained and test it on the famous iris data set, and compare my result with the `scikit-learn`'s built-in Random Forest. `scikit-learn`'s one was much better than mine.
